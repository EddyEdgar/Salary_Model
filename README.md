A machine learning model to predict if individuals earn above 50k or less than or equal to 50k  is available in this repository.
The machine learning model used is logistic regression and that is because the target variable is categorical(i.e, either less than or equal to 50k or more than 50k).
The data set can be found in the notebook.
